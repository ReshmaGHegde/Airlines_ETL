An Analysis of flight delays and frequent airline routes

Based on various flying factors such as on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights, the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Our original dataset is a humongous monthly summarization of first 3 months in 2015 with 10,48,576 data values, which was further narrowed down to Jan 2015 with 4,69,969 data values.

We observed that of all the 14 airlines, United Air Lines Inc. was on time for the max count of 1955 even though the airline seemed to have the maximum delay duration! On the other hand, Southwest Airlines Co. had the highest Delay Count of all the 14 airlines as compare to Virgin America that had the least delays.

The most frequent round-trip airline routes found between Los Angeles - New York with a max count of 2166 flights in the month of Jan 2015 whereas San Francisco - Los Angeles had the 2nd most frequent round-trip airline routes with 2149 flights.
